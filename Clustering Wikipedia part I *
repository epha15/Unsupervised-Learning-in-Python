#You saw in the video that TruncatedSVD is able to perform PCA on sparse arrays in csr_matrix format,
#such as word-frequency arrays. Combine your knowledge of TruncatedSVD and k-means to cluster some popular 
#pages from Wikipedia. In this exercise, build the pipeline. In the next exercise, you'll apply it to the 
#word-frequency array of some Wikipedia articles.

# Perform the necessary imports
from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

# Create a TruncatedSVD instance: svd
svd = TruncatedSVD(n_components=50)

# Create a KMeans instance: kmeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=6)

# Create a pipeline: pipeline
pipeline = make_pipeline(svd,kmeans)
