#Note that Normalizer() is different to StandardScaler(), 
#which you used in the previous exercise. While StandardScaler() standardizes features 
#(such as the features of the fish data from the previous exercise) by removing the mean 
#and scaling to unit variance, Normalizer() rescales each sample - here, each company's 
#stock price - independently of the other.

# Import Normalizer
from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer

# Create a normalizer: normalizer
normalizer = Normalizer()

# Create a KMeans model with 10 clusters: kmeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10)

# Make a pipeline chaining normalizer and kmeans: pipeline
pipeline = make_pipeline(normalizer,kmeans)

# Fit pipeline to the daily price movements
pipeline.fit(movements)
